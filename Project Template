#Project Template
##All Projects
* Each member should be assigned at least one component or task as agreed upon by the group, separate from all other components and members
* A component is a part of the project that will require development to complete, this could be a feature or a core part of the program.
* Those who complete their component can be assigned another component as agreed upon by the group.
* Questions should go to the project lead, then to the project committee member, then to one of the VPs of Engineering.

##Basic Projects
* Should have user input via command line
* Should use functions (or subroutines)
* Should use an array or list structure to store data, and choose which one based on appropriateness

##Intermediate Projects
* Project should be a desktop or web application with appropriate UI
* All error cases should be handled appropriately 
* Advanced data structures should be used (where needed) to make application more efficient and they should be optimal if possible

##Advanced Projects
* They need to use concurrency (threads)
* Space and time complexity should be manageable (max O(nlogn) time complexity)
* Should do data processing (for example parsing a csv, or querying a database)
* Should also satisfy the intermediate project requirements
