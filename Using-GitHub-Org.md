# Tutorial Remarks
If you want to follow along duplicate this tab and do so for each step of the way. This is a simple run down of using this
platform that also has a few checkpoints to make sure organizationally you are on the right track. **Important checks to keep an eye
out for will be bolded like so**. On with the tutorial!

### The following things should be done! If not, you need to follow this tutorial:
* You should know how to access the GitHub organization from your GitHub homepage (not just from links)
* You are listed in the Project-Teams.md file as a member of a team
* Your team has a repository set up and ready to go in the organization

# Where is the Organization Homepage?
It seems like a funny question as you are reading from the organization, but you may have just gotten here from a link.
How you find the organization on GitHub is the following:
1. Sign into GitHub
2. Click the GitHub logo at the top left of the page
3. Click the drop-down menu underneath the logo on that page that has your username on it, select UW-Madison-SDC
4. Click "View Organization" which should appear right below the drop-down menu

After doing that you should see our organization page pop up. Underneath our logo is a button bar. The notable buttons
on that are the Overview (the homepage itself), Repositories, and Teams.

You should also see our pinned SDC-Project repository.

# Where Is All the Project Information?
From organization homepage, click the pinned SDC-Projects repository. That is it! What you see right away is the general information,
the README.md file. It discusses where to apply, notes on how we plan on conducting projects over the semester, and a timeline of where you should be and
when for starters. It is a great resource, you should read it over completely.

In the repository above where the README.md starts are the rest of the files. The Project-Template.md has some resources and guidelines for difficulty of
projects and some example projects broken down. The Project-Teams.md is where all the teams are posted.

**Make sure you are listed in the Project-Teams.md file.** If you are not listed, then contact a VP of Engineering. Note your team and your teamates for further reference.

# Where Is My Team and Our Repositories?
1. Click on "Teams" on the button bar from the organization homepage.
2. Click on your team (see previous section if needed)

This will bring up the discussions page for your team. You can reach out to each other on here, but feel free to use whatever method works best for your team. 

Click the Members tab. **Check that you are a member of the team.** If not, please click "Request to Join" (or similar wording). It should be a large button next
to the search bar.

Next, click the Repositories tab on the button bar. **There should be one repository here for your team.** If there is not a repository,
then make one by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the organization homepage
2. Click the green "New" button next to the repository search bar.
3. Create a public repository with appropriate name, checking the add README.md button.
4. Once created, click the Settings button on the repo button bar.
5. Click the Collaborators and teams tab on the left column. It is under the Access header.
6. In the large Manage Access box, click "Add teams"
7. Search for your team and add it to the repository
