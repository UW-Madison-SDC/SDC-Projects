# SDC-Projects
Welcome to SDC Projects Spring 2022! Everything you need for working through Software Development Club Projects is right here in this GitHub!

If you have not applied to be a part of the projects and are interested in doing so this semester, please [apply here!](https://forms.gle/QR5Pr4stjnDHohG36)

## Timeline (Sundays)

|4/3| features done |
|4/10||
|4/17||
|4/24| Bugs are hammered out |
|5/1| Presentation!* |

^Note that this is how much 'feels' done. Software development is infamous for the difficulty of gauging how much work it will take for a particular aspect of a project.
If you are interested in how companies address this issue, I would recommend checking out Agile methodology. One day methods such as these may become a highlight of the club.
*Informal presentation where you share what you did, how you did, and what you learned with the group. For those interested we can put your project on the big screen and you can run through a demonstration.

## Shortcomings Last Semster
Projects are going to be similar to last year but we hope to address some challenges that occured. These are primarily:
* There was a lot of confusion with the random assignment of project leads as there were not enough applicants for the number of those interested in participating in projects
* Project levels were vague, and so were deadlines about the project, leaving many groups in the dark about when they should be done with what.
* There was no recognition for the work done on projects
* Many dropped out of their project, leaving their group members in the cold for a few reasons:
   * Some could not keep up with school work, project was not a priority
   * Some were frustratred with the project and lack of organization
   * Some simply showed up to the first meeting, applied to take part in a project, then realized they overcommited.

## Addressing the Shortcomings
We have attempted to address all of these issues (and of course if there were other issues, please let us know in the project form). We now have a more concrete definition of programming levels with approximate class breakdown (see form), we are trying to alleviate the randomness of leads, we are having an end of semester project celebration / informal presentation, and something you already likely noticed, we posted project applications after our first meeting. Additionally, we have a project template with some ideas on what a project of appropriate difficulty will look like, and some example projects that you could complete if you don't have any ideas. If you have an idea, but don't know how to break it up for your group, please email me (segedi@wisc.edu) and I will get back to you with my thoughts or I can schedule a chat so we can work through it together if you prefer.
