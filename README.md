# SDC-Projects
Welcome to SDC Projects Spring 2022! Everything you need for working through Software Development Club Projects is right here in this GitHub!

If you have not applied to be a part of the projects and are interested in doing so this semester, please [apply here!](https://forms.gle/QR5Pr4stjnDHohG36)

## Timeline (Sundays)
In person dates are bolded, which are every other non-break week starting 2/13 besides the presentation day
|Date|Benchmark|Tasks to be done|
|:----------:|:--------:|:--------|
|**2/13**| First Meeting | Be Excited! We will have assigned you to groups |
|2/20| Project Ideas and Components | Project you want to do is chosen, and components are assigned |
|**2/27**|  | 20% |
|3/6|  | Should be around 40% done |
|3/13| Break |  |
|3/20| Break |  |
|**3/27**| Check on Progress | Should be 60% done |
|4/3|  | 80% |
|**4/10**| Check on Progress | Should be done with core features (usable, if not pretty) |
|4/17|  |  |
|**4/24**|  |  |
|**5/1**| Presentation!* | A demonstration of your project should be thought out / done |

^Note that this is how much 'feels' done. Software development is infamous for the difficulty of gauging how much work it will take for a particular aspect of a project.
If you are interested in how companies address this issue, I would recommend checking out Agile methodology. One day methods such as these may become a highlight of the club.

*Informal presentation where you share what you did, how you did, and what you learned with the group. For those interested we can put your project on the big screen and you can run through a demonstration.

## How To Be Successful
* Make a schedule and stick to it as best as you can - it makes balancing class work, entertainment, and extracurriculars a much better time.
* Put in consistent work rather than putting it off and not getting to it. 
* Keep in mind that there is only 7 weeks to put your project together (9 if working over break).
* Communicate!

## Creating a Project
For those who wish to come up with their own project, check out the Project Template for general guidelines on the difficulty of a project you should take on. At the bottom of the Project Template are also ideas and examples of how to breakdown the project into components. The Project Template can be found in this repository. If you have an idea, but don't know how to break it up for your group, please email me (segedi@wisc.edu) and I will get back to you with my thoughts or I can schedule a chat so we can work through it together if you prefer. Ideally this would come up in our in person project meeting.

## Shortcomings Last Semester
Projects are going to be similar to last year but we hope to address some challenges that occured. These are primarily:
* There was a lot of confusion with the random assignment of project leads as there were not enough applicants for the number of those interested in participating in projects
* Project levels were vague, and so were deadlines about the project, leaving many groups in the dark about when they should be done with what.
* There was no recognition for the work done on projects
* Many dropped out of their project, leaving their group members in the cold for a few reasons:
   * Some could not keep up with school work, project was not a priority
   * Some were frustratred with the project and lack of organization
   * Some simply showed up to the first meeting, applied to take part in a project, then realized they overcommited.

## Addressing the Shortcomings
We have attempted to address all of these issues (and of course if there were other issues, please let us know in the project form). 
* We now have a more concrete definition of programming levels with approximate class breakdown (see form)
* We are decreasing the randomness of leads by asking for those who are willing to take on the role
* There is an end of semester project celebration / informal presentation
* This page is made available after our first meeting through the discord
* We have a project template with some ideas on what a project of appropriate difficulty will look like, and some example projects that you could complete if you don't have any ideas. 

## My Parting Thoughts
Projects are a chance to engage with your peers, learn how to work in a team, experience taking on responsibility and leadership, and work on your development skills. This makes these projects a fantastic oppurtunity for growth; however, they only provide as much as we put into them. In addition to that, they are extracurricular in nature, and everyone understands that classes can become overwhelming and take priority. If it is the case that you no longer wish to work on a project, please communicate with your point of contact that is the case.
